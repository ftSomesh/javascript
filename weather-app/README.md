## My process

### Built with

* **Semantic HTML5** markup
* **CSS custom properties**
* **Flexbox** for layout
* **Desktop-first** workflow
* **Responsive design** with media queries
* **Gradient backgrounds** and subtle shadows for a clean modern look
* **Weather App Api** for weather access

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **asynchronous programming** and **api integration**.

Some specific learnings include:

```css
/* Using text-align: center for centering block contents with 100% width. I knew the basic use of centering texts, i just didn't know it centers images, inside block level elements too. */
.card {
      text-align: center;
}


```

And a neat HTML snippet I’m proud of:

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="enter city name" autofocus list="citynames">
      <datalist id="citynames">
      <option value="odisha"></option>
      <option value="australia"></option>
      <option value="angul"></option>
</datalist>
```

---

### Continued development

In future projects, I’d like to:

* Add **automatic** location detection and show the user's weather by default.
* Experiment more with APIs.
* Focus more on **accessibility** and better **UI DESIGN**.
